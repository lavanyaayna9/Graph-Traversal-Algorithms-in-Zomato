# Graph-Traversal-Algorithms-in-Zomato
Introducing the menu browsing feature on Zomato, our project demonstrates the implementation of Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithms to enhance user experience. Graph traversal algorithms, such as Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS), form the backbone of Zomato's menu browsing feature.
 DFS meticulously explores the depths of menu categories, guiding users through a rich tapestry of dishes and subcategories. In contrast, BFS offers a systematic approach, ideal for navigating broader categories with efficiency and completeness. With DFS, users diving into a specific category, like "Pasta," are seamlessly guided through its depth, exploring various pasta dishes and subcategories methodically. Meanwhile, BFS facilitates a more systematic exploration, ideal for users navigating broader categories like "Appetizers." It efficiently presents items horizontally across categories before delving deeper, ensuring users experience a comprehensive overview of menu options. 
Through these implementations, Zomato empowers users with intuitive and efficient menu browsing, catering to diverse preferences and enhancing overall usability.
